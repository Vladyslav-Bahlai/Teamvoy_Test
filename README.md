# Teamvoy_Test

I've never worked with Java 11 and don't have it installed on my computer, that's why I've created my project using Java 8 in order 
to avoid possible unpredictable bugs in my program.

I haven't completely understood what was expected from me to do to implement deleting invalid orders after 10 minutes feature. 
I assume that I had to do it without creating 'creationTimeStamp' field in Order entity that's why I went with a scheduled task approach
Also I have no idea how to properly test this kind of functionality, so I have ommited this step.

In conclusion I want to point out that I have never been learning testing in Java. That's why I had to learn it from scratch and in rush, so I believe 
that all the test code may be outdated and not very clean at some places, cuz I'm not sure how to find relevant info about new Spring features on the Internet
